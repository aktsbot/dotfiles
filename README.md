# dotfiles â˜…

These are config files for my linux machines. Most of them are stolen / borrowed from here and there. I'm now on a **NO RICE** streak, hence the plain scrot ðŸ˜…

## setup

I run i3wm on Ubuntu 18.04. To get the programs I use,

```
$ sudo apt install rxvt-unicode-256color tmux neovim i3 nitrogen lxappearance xfce4-power-manager fonts-hack-ttf fonts-noto parcellite compton unclutter xautolock redshift xserver-xorg-input-synaptics x11-xkb-util rofi tmux zsh
```

I'm sure the above list is not full, but it's enough to get one started. [Here's](https://blog.aktsbot.in/lubuntu-i3wm-awesomeness.html) a little blog post to get to know my i3wm workflow ðŸ˜‰

The only main change(aside from the plane setup) from my previous setup is that I've moved over to [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and [neovim](https://neovim.io/) + [plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
