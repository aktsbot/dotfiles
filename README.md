# dotfiles

These are my personal configs for the software I use on my home and work machines.
I saw one of Drew DeVault's [live streams](https://live.drewdevault.com/) and was
hooked on his [swaywm](https://swaywm.org/) setup. Hence, the setup I'm running now
is almost an exact copy of his dotfiles. So, credits to him!

This is [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) running on top of [voidlinux](https://voidlinux.org/). 
And yes, I'm a hopeless distro-hopping maniac!

`happy hacking`
